The psychometric curves is generated by the following equation:

$$
P(a=1|w)=\Phi(w_1 \times V+ w_2 \times RU + w_3 \times V/TU)
$$

where $w_1$ is fixed to 1, and the value of $w_2$, $w_3$ are assigned arbitrarily for the sake of demonstration. RU is fixed to 1 for convenience in SR condition, while in rR condition RU is fixed to 0.55. TU is assigned to 1.72 and 1.89 respectively. (Please read the pdf or code for detail and reason)

H1: High intolerance of uncertainty (IU) lead to less direct exploration

H2: High impulsivity (IM) will lead to more random exploration

H3: In loss condition, participates with lower IU will show a similar level of direct exploration compared to participates with higher IU. In win condition, participates with lower IU will show a greater increase in direct exploration compared to participates with higher IU.

H4: In win condition, participates with higher IM will show a small higher random exploration compared to participates with lower IM In loss condition, participates with higher IM will show a greater increase in random exploration compared to participates with lower IM.
